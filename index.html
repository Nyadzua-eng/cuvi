        <h3>Design and development</h3>
          <p class="outro">
            It has always been my desire to build websites and apps since i was 12 years old.As i
            grew up i admired gaming apps but i had no idea how they were built since i could not
            access a computer until i was 16 years old.Later in life i was lucky to access
            unlimited internet and this motivated me to learn coding.

          <h3>Baking</h3>

          <p class="intro">  Baking is my healer and reliever whenever i feel fatiqued due to staring at the
            system for a long time .I take a break and make choco muffins which are my favourite.
            Mint and Lemon cake follow.When the two flavours are blended it brings out an unexplainable
            mouth-watering taste.
